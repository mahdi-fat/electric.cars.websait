        <h1>Electric Cars Around the World</h1>
        <h2>Any vehicle that combines two or more power transmission engines that are directly or indirectly dependent on the power transmission system is called a "hybrid car". Most hybrid cars in production so far are a combination of gasoline-electric engines, although some, such as the Peugeot Citroen, are diesel-electric.</h2>

            <head>History of electric and gasoline engines</head> 
            <body>The first practical electric cars were introduced in the 1880s. Electric cars were common in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until the production of such cars suffered a sharp decline with the development of internal combustion engines and especially the electric start of the car and the mass production of cheap gasoline cars.</body>

        <body>Generally, in hybrid cars, there is an electric motor that gets its electric energy from the battery. On the other side is a small internal combustion engine that either directly powers the wheels, or charges the battery through a generator.</body>

        <h1>__the future of electric cars</h1>
        <p1>The importance of electric cars in terms of environment, economy and energy has caused many countries of the world to plan to expand the use of these cars in the not-so-distant future. For example, in many European countries, regulations have been established to phase out gasoline and diesel vehicles by the end of 2030. Norway is a leader in this field and has planned to stop the production of gasoline cars in 2025.</p1>
